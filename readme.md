# Simple Chat Bot (JavaScript)

Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chatbot will do wonders to guide you
through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to
implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course
to get it built. Here’s what awaits you:

### ▶️ Stage 1/5: Chatty Bot welcomes you

Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.

### ▶️ Stage 2/5: Print your name

Introduce yourself to the bot.

### ▶️ Stage 3/5: Guess the age

Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.

### ▶️ Stage 4/5: Learning numbers

Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a for loop at this stage!

### ▶️ Stage 5/5: Multiple choice

At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. Add some functions
to your code and make the stage even better.
